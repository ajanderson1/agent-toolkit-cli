"""Diagnose + repair skill-installation drift.

Pure-ish engine: diagnose() reads lock + filesystem and returns Findings.
Each Finding carries an idempotent fix_action.apply() closure that the
CLI calls after the user confirms. No mutation happens here; that's the
caller's responsibility (via fix_action.apply).
